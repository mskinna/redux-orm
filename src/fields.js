/**
 * Defines a foreign key on a model, which points
 * to a single entity on another model.
 *
 * You can pass arguments as either a single object,
 * or two arguments.
 *
 * If you pass two arguments, the first one is the name
 * of the Model the foreign key is pointing to, and
 * the second one is an optional related name, which will
 * be used to access the Model the foreign key
 * is being defined from, from the target Model.
 *
 * If the related name is not passed, it will be set as
 * `${toModelName}Set`.
 *
 * If you pass an object to `fk`, it has to be in the form
 *
 * ```javascript
 * fields = {
 *   author: fk({ to: 'Author', relatedName: 'books' })
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Which is equal to
 *
 * ```javascript
 * fields = {
 *   author: fk('Author', 'books'),
 * }

 *                                           foreign key, or an object with properties
 *                                           `to` and optionally `relatedName`.
 * @param {string} [relatedName] - if you didn't pass an object as the first argument,
 *                                 this is the property name that will be used to
 *                                 access a QuerySet the foreign key is defined from,

/**
 * Defines a many-to-many relationship between
 * this (source) and another (target) model.
 *
 * The relationship is modeled with an extra model called the through model.
 * The through model has foreign keys to both the source and target models.
 *
 * You can define your own through model if you want to associate more information
 * to the relationship. A custom through model must have at least two foreign keys,
 * one pointing to the source Model, and one pointing to the target Model.
 *
 * If you have more than one foreign key pointing to a source or target Model in the
 * through Model, you must pass the option `throughFields`, which is an array of two
 * strings, where the strings are the field names that identify the foreign keys to
 * be used for the many-to-many relationship. Redux-ORM will figure out which field name
 * points to which model by checking the through Model definition.
 *
 * Unlike `fk`, this function accepts only an object argument.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * class Authorship extends Model {}
 * Authorship.modelName = 'Authorship';
 * Authorship.fields = {
 *   author: fk('Author', 'authorships'),
 *   book: fk('Book', 'authorships'),
 * };
 *
 * class Author extends Model {}
 * Author.modelName = 'Author';
 * Author.fields = {
 *   books: many({
 *     to: 'Book',
 *     relatedName: 'authors',
 *     through: 'Authorship',
 *
 *     // this is optional, since Redux-ORM can figure
 *     // out the through fields itself as there aren't
 *     // multiple foreign keys pointing to the same models.
 *     throughFields: ['author', 'book'],
 *   })
 * };
 *
 * class Book extends Model {}
 * Book.modelName = 'Book';
 * ```
 *
 * You should only define the many-to-many relationship on one side. In the
 * above case of Authors to Books through Authorships, the relationship is
 * defined only on the Author model.
 *
 * @param  {Object} options - options
 * @param  {string} options.to - the `modelName` attribute of the target Model.
 * @param  {string} [options.through] - the `modelName` attribute of the through Model which
 *                                    must declare at least one foreign key to both source and
 *                                    target Models. If not supplied, Redux-Orm will autogenerate
 *                                    one.
 * @param  {string[]} [options.throughFields] - this must be supplied only when a custom through
 *                                            Model has more than one foreign key pointing to
 *                                            either the source or target mode. In this case
 *                                            Redux-ORM can't figure out the correct fields for
 *                                            you, you must provide them. The supplied array should
 *                                            have two elements that are the field names for the
 *                                            through fields you want to declare the many-to-many
 *                                            relationship with. The order doesn't matter;
 *                                            Redux-ORM will figure out which field points to
 *                                            the source Model and which to the target Model.
 * @param  {string} [options.relatedName] - the attribute used to access a QuerySet
